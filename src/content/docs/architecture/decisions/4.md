This decision record outlines the adoption of Svelte for building interactive UI components.

Decision made by `site owner` on `15.08.2023`.

## Context

The requirement for a modern, lightweight, and efficient framework for creating interactive user interfaces.
It is required for dynamic components as Astro is focused on static-first components support.

## Alternatives Considered

- **React**: Offers a large ecosystem but can be heavier on the client-side.
- **Vue.js**: Simplified development but slightly larger runtime.

## Rationale

Svelte's compile-time approach to building web applications results in highly efficient and optimized JavaScript, leading to faster load times and improved performance.

## Implications

Enhanced user experience, reduced load times, and a more maintainable codebase.
