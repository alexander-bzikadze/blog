This decision record outlines the adoption of Material Design as the primary design system for the website.

Decision made by `site owner` on `3.11.2023`.

Depricated by ["Design System on top of Material Design and Flowbite"](../12.md)

## Context

The need for a cohesive and well-established design language to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Taiwind UI**: Tailwind's take on a components library, connected with frameworks and Figma. However, not free.
- **Ant Design**: A different design philosophy centered around enterprise applications, bound to Vue, React and Angular.

## Rationale

Material Design provides a comprehensive design system backed by extensive guidelines, ensuring a consistent, user-friendly interface across various platforms and devices.

## Implications

Enhanced user experience through familiar design patterns, leading to a more intuitive navigation and interaction.
Worth noting that material web is in not stable yet and there exist certain differences between token management in material design definition and material web implementation.
