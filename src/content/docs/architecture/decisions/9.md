This decision record outlines the adoption of pnpm as the package manager for the website.

Decision made by `site owner` on `19.11.2023`.

## Context

Need for an efficient and reliable package manager to handle dependencies.

## Alternatives Considered

- **npm**: The default package manager for Node.js, widely used but less efficient in handling node_modules.
- **Yarn**: Offers improved performance over npm, but can have compatibility issues.
- **Deno**: A different JS runtime that has a level of compatibility with node packages.

## Rationale

pnpm offers superior performance with its efficient handling of node_modules and dependency management, while still being compatible with the npm registry.
At the same time Deno's compatibility currently has few issues and requires additional investments to make it work.

## Implications

Faster installation times, efficient disk space usage, and improved project performance.
