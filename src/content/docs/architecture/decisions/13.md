This decision record outlines the adoption of [arc42](https://arc42.org/) as a template for architecture description.

Decision made by `site owner` on `2.3.2024`.

## Context

Currently adopted [ISO 42010](https://www.iso.org/standard/74393.html) sets common terminology, concepts and relationship between them.
However, the standard does not impose one particular way of creating architecture description.
In order to provide guidance and reuse public experience, this architecture description needs a framework or a template.

## Rationale

arc42 offers a straightforward format for architecture description.
As it is lightweight, it requires minimum effort to learn.

## Implications

This decision will provide clarity on required sections of the architecture description.
Transition of current architecture description to arc42 will require only restructure of `concerns` section.
