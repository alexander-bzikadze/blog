This decision record outlines the adoption of GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automation workflows.

Decision made by `site owner` on `05.08.2023`.

## Context

The need for a robust, integrated CI/CD solution that seamlessly works with the GitHub repository.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Jenkins**: Offers extensive customization but requires separate hosting and maintenance.
- **Travis CI**: Known for simplicity but lacks deeper integration with GitHub.

## Rationale

GitHub Actions provides deep integration with GitHub repositories, supports a wide range of workflows, and eliminates the need for external CI/CD services.
The community around Github actions is well established and provides a lot of ready-to-use open-source solution.

## Implications

Enhanced automation, streamlined deployment processes, and better collaboration within the GitHub environment.
