This decision record outlines the adoption of elements of Material Design and Flowbite as a custom design system.

Decision made by `site owner` on `22.12.2023`.

Depricates ["Material Design as a Design System"](../7.md)

## Context

The need for a cohesive and well-established design language to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience.

Material Design was tested before, however, its web implementation is lacking.

- Material Web is poorly integratable with Tailwind CSS as it relies on CSS variables.
- It is impossible to use glass morphism effect with Material Web.
- Material Web is not stable and has a limited amount of available components.

In addition, it is a good learning experience to maintain own design system.

## Rationale

Material Design provides is backed by extensive guidelines, color system.
It is beneficial to continue using it as a reference and select components carefully.

For component library inspiration, Flowbite can be used as a reference and a framework.
It does not provide implementation for all components, but it has guidelines on their creation.

## Implications

Decision to use own design system will require additional investments in development and maintenance.
