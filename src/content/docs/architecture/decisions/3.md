This decision record outlines the choice of GitHub Pages as the hosting platform for the personal website.

Decision made by `site owner` on `5.08.2023`.

## Context

The requirement for a simple, reliable, and cost-effective hosting solution that integrates well with the existing GitHub repository.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Vercel**: Provides advanced deployment features and superior performance but may require additional configuration.
- **Firebase**: Offers a full suite of web application services including hosting, but its broader scope goes beyond mere hosting needs.

## Rationale

GitHub Pages provides a straightforward hosting solution directly integrated with GitHub, offering ease of deployment and minimal configuration.
It lacks preview functionality and this decision is going to be revised in the future.

## Implications

Streamlined deployment process, free hosting, and improved integration with the GitHub workflow.
