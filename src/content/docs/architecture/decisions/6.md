This decision record outlines the use of Astro Starlight for organizing and presenting project documentation.

Decision made by `site owner` on `3.11.2023`.

## Context

Requirement for an efficient and flexible documentation system that integrates well with the existing web framework.

## Rationale

Astro Starlight offers an easy-to-use, markdown-based documentation system, perfectly aligning with the existing Astro.js framework used for the website.

## Implications

Streamlined documentation process, ease of updates, and cohesive integration with the website's overall architecture.
Worth noting that Starlight is not yet stable at the time of the decision, and will potentially change a lot over time.
This also presents an opportunity to identify points of improvement and contribute to it.
