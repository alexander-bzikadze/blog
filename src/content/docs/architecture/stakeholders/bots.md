To maximize visibility and attract organic traffic, search engines and bots should effectively index and rank the site.
Their interest lies in the site's technical structure, content relevance, and overall health.

## Goals

- Efficiently index the site for relevant search queries.
- Measure and reward website health and mobile-friendliness.
- Recognize and rank based on the usage of effective SEO techniques.

## Interest

**Low Interest.** While search engines evaluate and rank countless websites, they don't have a personal stake in any single site's success. Their primary focus is on delivering relevant and high-quality search results to users.

## Power

**High Power.** Search engines have significant influence over the website's online visibility. Their ranking algorithms can drastically affect the amount of organic traffic the site receives.
