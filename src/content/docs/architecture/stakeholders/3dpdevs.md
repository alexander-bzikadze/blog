Developers that offer tools, plugins, or widgets enhancing the site's functionality, aesthetics, or user engagement.

## Goals

- Deliver value to the site through integration.
- Receive feedback for improvements, bugs, or enhancements.
- Benefit from promotion of their tools.

## Interest

**Low Interest.** Third-party developers benefit from the use of their work in form of promotion and feedback, however, they are not the most affected party.

## Power

**Minimal Power.** As third-party developers are not directly involved, their impact is minimal. However, due to the fact that the site relies on the software they own, their influence should not be overlooked.
